#🏥 FDA Adverse Event Reporting Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

Ensuring patient safety requires continuous monitoring of adverse events associated with drugs, medical devices, and consumer products. This project analyzes data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) using Microsoft Power BI to identify meaningful trends, high-risk products, and vulnerable patient groups.

The goal of this project is to build an interactive and insight-driven Power BI dashboard that enables healthcare analysts, regulators, and decision-makers to explore adverse event data efficiently and make informed, data-driven decisions.

🎯 Business Objectives

Identify high-risk product categories linked to adverse events

Analyze adverse events across age groups and gender

Understand trends in serious vs non-serious outcomes

Monitor reporting patterns over time

Support proactive healthcare safety and regulatory analysis

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset is sourced from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and includes thousands of records with the following attributes:

Patient demographics (Age, Gender)

Product category and product type

Reported symptoms

Event outcomes (serious / non-serious)

Reporting year and trends

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Power BI

Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

DAX for calculated measures and KPIs

Interactive visuals, slicers, and filters

🔄 Data Preparation

Data preparation was performed in Power Query, including:

Handling missing and inconsistent values

Standardizing product categories

Grouping patient ages into meaningful ranges

Removing duplicate and irrelevant records

Creating derived fields for analysis

These steps ensured the dataset was clean, reliable, and analysis-ready.

📈 Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes:

📌 KPIs for total adverse event reports

📊 Product-category-wise adverse event analysis

👥 Demographic breakdown by age group and gender

⚠️ Serious vs non-serious outcome comparison
